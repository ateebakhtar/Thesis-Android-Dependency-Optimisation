## AndroStep: Android Storage Performance Analysis Tool

---

### Extracted Information

1. **Problem Identified**:
    - Existing **IO workload generators** and **trace capturing tools** are not designed to handle the unique IO requests generated by Android applications.
    - There is a lack of tools specifically tailored to analyze the **storage performance** and **IO subsystem behavior** in Android-based devices.

2. **Proposed Solution**:
    - The authors introduce **AndroStep**, a tool designed for characterizing and analyzing the IO subsystem in Android devices.
    - AndroStep consists of two main components:
        - **Mobibench**: A workload generator that simulates typical filesystem workloads (e.g., random vs. sequential, synchronous vs. buffered IO) and Android-specific workloads (e.g., SQLite insert/update, write with `fsync()`).
        - **Mobile Storage Analyzer (MOST)**: A workload analyzer that captures IO traces and extracts key filesystem access characteristics, such as access patterns, random vs. sequential access ratios, and metadata access fractions.

3. **Key Features**:
    - **Mobibench**:
        - Generates concurrent workloads to examine storage and filesystem overhead (e.g., metadata updates, journal file creation/deletion).
        - Supports varying numbers of concurrent threads to test concurrency performance.
    - **MOST**:
        - Implements **reverse mapping** (finding an inode for a given block) and **retrospective reverse mapping** (finding an inode for a deleted file).
        - Analyzes IO traces to provide insights into filesystem behavior.

4. **Experimental Validation**:
    - AndroStep was tested on **eight smartphone models** to verify its performance and effectiveness.
    - The tool successfully captured and analyzed IO workloads, providing valuable insights into storage performance.
