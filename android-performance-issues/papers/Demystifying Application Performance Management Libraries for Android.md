## Demystifying Application Performance Management Libraries for Android

---

### Extracted Information

1. **Problem Identified**:
    - Developers use **Application Performance Management (APM)** tools to monitor and detect performance bottlenecks in Android apps, but most developers lack a deep understanding of how these tools work.
    - APMs may have limitations, such as using deprecated permissions or inadvertently collecting users' private information.
    - Existing studies on APMs do not systematically analyze their functionalities or reveal implementation details.

2. **Proposed Solution**:
    - The authors conduct a systematic study of **25 widely-used APMs** for Android to demystify their functionalities and limitations.
    - They perform a **large-scale empirical study** on **500,000 Android apps** from Google Play to explore how APMs are used in practice.

3. **Key Findings**:
    - **APM Functionalities**:
        - Capturing crashes, network diagnostics, ANR (Application Not Responding) errors, Time-on-Page (ToP) analysis, logging/tracking, memory usage, CPU utilization, and time consumption.
    - **Limitations**:
        - Some APMs use deprecated permissions (e.g., `READ_LOGS`, `READ_PHONE_STATE`).
        - Some APMs rely on outdated approaches that may not work properly on newer Android versions.
        - APMs can be used to collect sensitive user data, leading to privacy concerns.
    - **Empirical Study Results**:
        - **11% of apps** (55,722 out of 500,000) use APMs, with higher usage in entertainment and lifestyle apps.
        - **42% of APM-using apps** (23,397 out of 55,722) collect sensitive user data, such as device IDs, location, and network information.

4. **Contributions**:
    - First systematic study of 25 popular APMs for Android, revealing their key functionalities and limitations.
    - Large-scale empirical study highlighting the prevalence of APMs and their misuse for collecting sensitive data.
    - Release of experimental datasets and results for further research.
