## Performance Analysis for Improved RAM Utilization for Android Applications

---

### Extracted Information

1. **Problem Identified**:
    - Android devices often come preloaded with applications that consume significant **RAM**, leading to inefficient memory utilization.
    - The default **SMS messaging service** in Android consumes more memory due to **UTF-8 encoding**, which doubles the byte size of text messages.
    - There is a need for **memory optimization** to improve the performance of Android devices, especially for applications running on devices with limited RAM.

2. **Proposed Solution**:
    - The authors developed **SMSLingo**, a dictionary-based SMS compression application, to reduce memory consumption and improve RAM utilization.
    - SMSLingo uses a **hybrid compression algorithm** (combining Huffman Encoding and Run-Length Encoding) to compress SMS texts while maintaining readability.
    - The application was compared with the default Android messaging service and other third-party SMS compression apps in terms of **memory usage**, **application size**, and **compression ratio**.

3. **Key Findings**:
    - **SMSLingo** consumes **3.49 MB of RAM**, significantly less than the default messaging service (8.88 MB) and other third-party apps (15.5 MB).
    - The application size of SMSLingo is **76 KB**, much smaller than other SMS compression apps (up to 1.78 MB).
    - SMSLingo achieves a **compression ratio of 82.92%**, outperforming Huffman Encoding (44.76%) and Run-Length Encoding (71.84%).
    - The application allows **readable SMS texts** without requiring decompression, further optimizing memory usage.

4. **Contributions**:
    - Development of **SMSLingo**, a lightweight SMS compression app for Android.
    - Demonstration of improved **RAM utilization** and **memory optimization** through compression techniques.
    - Comparison of SMSLingo with existing SMS services and compression apps, highlighting its efficiency.
