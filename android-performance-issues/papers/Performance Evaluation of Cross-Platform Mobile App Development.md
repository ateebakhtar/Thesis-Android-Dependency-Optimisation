## Performance Evaluation of Cross-Platform Mobile App Development Frameworks for Android

---

### Extracted Information

1. **Problem Identified**:
    - Mobile app user retention rates are low (31% to 39%), indicating that performance and user experience (UX) are critical for retaining users.
    - Cross-platform development frameworks improve development efficiency but often degrade app performance and UX.
    - Existing studies on cross-platform frameworks lack comprehensive performance evaluations, especially for newer frameworks like **Flutter** and **React Native**.

2. **Proposed Solution**:
    - The authors conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of **Flutter** and **React Native** (cross-platform frameworks) against **Native Android** (baseline).
    - Performance is measured using five parameters: **CPU usage**, **memory usage**, **response time**, **frame rate**, and **app size**.

3. **Key Findings**:
    - **Native Android** provides the best performance across all parameters.
    - Among cross-platform frameworks, **Flutter** (widget-based) performs better than **React Native**.
    - Performance metrics are critical for quantifying user experience and improving retention rates.

4. **Contributions**:
    - Development of a test application simulating a social media app to evaluate performance.
    - Creation of automated UI test scenarios for consistent performance measurement.
    - Comprehensive performance comparison of Native Android, Flutter, and React Native.
