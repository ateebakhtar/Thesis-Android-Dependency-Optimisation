### Extracted Information

1. **Problem Identified**:
    - The **Academic Information System (AIS)** at UIN Jakarta, available as a web and Android-based application, faced performance issues.
    - 13 out of 39 users complained about the performance of the AIS Mobile application.
    - The current version of AIS Mobile was built using **hybrid Android**, which has performance limitations compared to **native Android**.

2. **Proposed Solution**:
    - The author researched and developed a new version of AIS Mobile using **native Android** to improve performance.
    - Native Android is chosen because it can create applications with better performance compared to hybrid Android, as per **ISO/IEC 25010** standards.
