# MigrationMiner: An Automated Detection Tool of Third-Party Java Library Migration at the Method Level

- Tools for detecting migration has happened
- Suggests possible code changes and documentation to new libraries or replaced libraries
- Checks the commit and diffs in a github project
- Uses set rules to extract out changes and suggest possible code changes according to new library 
- Link for the tools http://migrationlab.net/

### Learnings 
- Not super related to our work
- Will be useful to extend or adopt, if we recommend any library then we can use this tool to suggest code changes 
- Might only be working for Java code
