## Dataset

We have to make a dataset, and for that there a few challenges that  need to be addressed.
What we need is open source applications, their apk size, the size of libraries and what libraries are being used, in the form of dependency tree.

#### What we have so far
- Script to take out apk size
- Script to take out libraries size of an APK
- Script to take out dependency tree
- Collect a list or find a list of open source android applications

#### What we need 
- Make the script iterable on multiple repositories
- Make a script to determine what projects are compilable in our given environment
- Make a script to see what repositories are compilable 

#### Sample links to help me 
- List of libraries categorized (https://github.com/thanhtoan1196/awesome-android-libraries)
- List of open source projects (https://github.com/offa/android-foss.git)
- Another list of open source projects (https://github.com/binaryshrey/Awesome-Android-Open-Source-Projects)
